# Temperature App for Esp8266
A simple micropython temperature app which uses tomorrow.io's weather api to fetch weather data of a city using esp8266's wifi feature and i2c screen to show the realtime data also updates after every 1800 seconds made as a hobby project also presented it as my project for my Physics Practical and Computer Science Practical
# Things Needed
1. Esp8266 - esp8266 microcontroller flashed with micropython
2. I2C OLED SCREEN - a i2c screen to show the data
3. Breadboard - to allow the connections can also use the connector wires without the need of breadboard
4. Microusb Cable - to flash your code to esp and power it
5. Mircopython IDE - a ide which supports micropython and esp8266 i used thonny
